#' Aggregated investment cost data for REMIND regions (based on IEA_WEO)
#' @description Disaggregated investment cost data is aggregated and technologies renamed to REMIND names 
#' @details REMIND does not have a classification of coal power plants e.g., sub-critical. Therefore, countries are given coal plant
#' costs assuming what type of coal plants are expected to develop there. For other technologies, certain assumptions are taken
#' to change to REMIND convention.
#' @param subtype Investment Costs, I&M Costs, and Efficiency
#' @return Magpie object with aggregated but diffrentiated investment costs for some technologies.
