  # MAIN CALCULATION:
  # 1. Derive scenario-specific emission factors for 2030-2100.
  #    This includes removing incomplete timeseries, filling NAs,
  #    amd removing large spikes.
  # 2. Calculate baseline emission factors for 2005-2030 based on
  #    emissions and activities in the baseline scenario.
  #    This includes filling NAs, removing large spikes, and
  #    ensuring that emission factors in 2005-2025 are not below 2030 level.
  # 3. Combine 1. and 2. by rescaling baseline emission factors (1.) so that
  #    in 2030, it is equal to the scenario-specific emission factor (2.) of
  #    the SSP2-SMIPbySSP scenario. This preserves relative changes between
  #    timesteps and allows to smoothly concatenate the emission factors
  #    before and after 2030

  # 1. DERIVE SCENARIO-SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTORS FOR 2030-2100 ===================

  # emission factors, but only emissions and activities, are available)

  #            1.3. If there are NAs in intermediate timesteps, use linear inter-

  #            The linear interpolation should be done whenever data is available
  #            for an earlier and for a later timestep.

  #               future emission factors. If future emission factors are zero,
  #               the multiplication in 3.1 will set the timeseries back to 0s.
  #            2. Rescale (c) non-zero timeseries so that 2030 value is equal
