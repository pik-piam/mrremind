\usage{
calcBiocharLimitCropland(
  dataBCLimit = "CRCF_draft_2025",
  adoptShare = 1,
  refYear = "y2020",
  annualLimit = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataBCLimit}{Character scalar selecting the application-rate limit source.
Options:
"CRCF_draft_2025": cumulative application limit of 50 t/ha over any 10-year period.
"Conservative": annual application rate of 1 t/ha/yr (illustrative, non-regulatory)}

\item{adoptShare}{Adoption share of cropland treated with biochar.}

\item{refYear}{Character scalar selecting the reference year (e.g. "y2015").}

\item{annualLimit}{Logical. If TRUE: compute annual flow ceiling (t/yr).
If FALSE: compute cumulative stock capacity (t) for compliance window.
Note: If data source contains an annual rate, the compliance window
is interpreted as 1 year (only annual limits make semantic sense here).}

\description{
Provides back-of-envelope upper limits of biochar application on cropland.

Estimates upper limits as either cumulative stock capacity (t) over a
compliance window, or as annual flow ceiling (t/yr) for cropland soils,
using physical cropland area, adoption shares, and application-rate limits per area.
