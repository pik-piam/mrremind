\title{Calculate projected electricity from waste and other fossils
using energy demands from IEA Energy Balances.}
\usage{
calcOtherFossilInElectricity()
}
\description{
This is used in remind2 reporting as input data to calculate additional
capacity and secondary energy variables.
}
\details{
The projection focuses on a tight mitigation scenario and assumes that all
fossil emissions from waste burning / other fossil processes can be reduced
to 0 by 2050. Should be replaced in the future by actual modeling of waste /
other fossil plants, or at least connected to RCP scenario assumptions.
